/**
 * @file TriondaBallSpotsProvider.h
 *
 * Provides BallSpots by detecting orange-colored regions directly in the
 * YUYV camera image.  Designed to find the "trionda" FIFA mini ball whose
 * color (orange) is not reliably detected by BHuman's scan-line / BOP-based
 * BallSpotsProvider.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *   1. Scan the image at configurable step intervals.
 *   2. Classify each pixel as "orange" using a YCrCb threshold in YUYV space
 *      (Cr = V component, high; Cb = U component, low; Y = luminance, mid-range).
 *   3. Merge nearby orange pixels into blobs using a greedy centroid approach.
 *   4. Emit the centroid of every blob that exceeds a minimum pixel count.
